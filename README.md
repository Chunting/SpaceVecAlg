[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jorisv/SpaceVecAlg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jorisv/SpaceVecAlg)

SpaceVecAlg aim to implement spatial vector algebra with the Eigen3 linear algebra library.

All this implementation is based on appendix A of Roy Featherstone Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms book.
